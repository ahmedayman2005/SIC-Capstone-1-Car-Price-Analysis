#  Capstone Project 1 — Car Dataset Analysis
Samsung Innovation Campus — AI Track

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes a large car dataset to understand the most important factors affecting car prices, such as:

- Horsepower  
- Number of cylinders  
- Fuel type  
- Vehicle size  
- Model year  
- City & Highway MPG  

The project includes:

- Full data cleaning  
- Handling missing values & duplicates  
- Outlier detection & correction  
- Feature engineering  
- Data visualization  
- Insights & final conclusions

##  Data Cleaning Summary

- **715 duplicate rows removed**
- Missing values filled using:
  - **Mode** → Engine Fuel Type  
  - **Median** → Engine HP  
  - **Zero** → Engine Cylinders for electric cars  
- Dropped **Market Category** due to high missing rate  
- Applied **log transformation** on MSRP to manage outliers  
- Corrected unrealistic values in city/highway MPG

##  Key Insights

- American manufacturers like **Chevrolet** and **Ford** dominate car production counts  
- **Bugatti** has the highest average MSRP across all manufacturers  
- Electric cars show extremely high fuel efficiency values  
- Best value-for-money cars:
  - Many **90s luxury sedans**
  - **Chevrolet Camaro 2015**
- Worst value-for-money cars:
  - **Maybach Landaulet**
  - **Acura ILX Hybrid**
